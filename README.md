# battlezone
Adaptation of the classic arcade game, Battlezone, written in JavaScript.

When Battlezone first hit arcades in 1980, punters had seen nothing like
the game's open, seemingly endless 3D environment. Despite battlezone being
a combat simulator, many were inspired to leave the battlefield behind
and drive off towards the mountains in the distance. This spawned a number of
[legends](http://www.recroom-amusements.com/aboutbattlezone.htm) amongst the players,
including the possibility of exploring the volcano, where a castle could supposedly
be found. Sadly, it seems these legends weren't true... Until now.

**This is a work in progress.**
