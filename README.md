# battlezone
Adaptation of the classic arcade game, Battlezone, written in JavaScript.

Battlezone's (then) unique 3D environment inspired a number of
[legends](http://www.recroom-amusements.com/aboutbattlezone.htm) amongst game-players,
including the possibility to drive away from the battlefield and into the volcano, where a
castle could be found. Of course, these legends weren't true, but what if they were?

**This is a work in progress.**
